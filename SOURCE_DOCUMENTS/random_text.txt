The feeling of surreal or hazy experience after an accident is often described as "disorienting" or "unreal." People may feel a sense of detachment from reality, as if they are in a dream or a fog. This state, known as dissociation, can include a distorted perception of time, space, and one's surroundings. There might also be a sense of disbelief or numbness, where the event feels like it's happening to someone else or isn't real at all.
